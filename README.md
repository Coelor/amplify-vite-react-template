## üõ†Ô∏è Amplify Sandbox

Use the Amplify Sandbox plugin to spin up an isolated backend & frontend environment for testing:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox
```

This single command will:

1. Create (or switch to) a `sandbox` environment in Amplify
2. Deploy all configured backend resources (Cognito, AppSync, DynamoDB, etc.)
3. Deploy the frontend to that sandbox

Once you‚Äôre done experimenting, you can tear down the sandbox with:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox delete
```
